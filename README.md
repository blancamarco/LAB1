- Hi! My name is Blanca Marco Reglero.

- I am currently studying biomedical engineering at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.

- I am most interested in the part of genetic, cells and tissues engineering, synthetic biology... But also the whole part of programming and mechanics with medical applications!

- You can contact me through my email: blancacatalina.marco01@estudiant.upf.edu.

Let's talk about epilepsy. A disease that is widely known and suffered, as it is in fact the second most common brain disorder in the world with an incidence of roughly 50 new cases per 100,000 population and a prevalence of 1%. 
About one third of all patients are resistant to medical treatment, so for them, surgical treatment is the main alternative, which consists on the resection or ablation of the Epileptogenic Zone. 
However, despite the usage of advanced methods for surgical evaluation like intracranial EEG or PET-MRI, at least half of all intervened patients will end up recurring in the long term. Many computational approaches have been taken in order to aid in the prediction of the outcome of epilepsy surgery but to this day, none of them have managed to obtain a perfect accuracy. 

The author of the TFG that I am presenting, in his work aimed to comprehend the interactions that take place between pathological and surrounding networks in the epileptic brain in order to delimit the epileptic focus; and, on this basis, offer a safe pre-surgical predictive method to those drug-resistant patients who have no choice but to undergo surgery.

The work is divided into 4 main parts, consisting of a Transition Map where the iEEG signals are preprocessed and summarizes the information about the connectivity changes in the studied areas of the brain; calculate the State Frequency, which allows for the observation of the competition between networks; and calculate the Global Score, which predicts the surgery outcome that is then used to propose a new methodology of Epileptogenic Zone Mapping.
